# NFL Football Stats
My family has always been serious about fantasy football. I've managed my own team since elementary school. It's a fun reason to talk with each other on a weekly basis for almost half the year. 

Ever since I was in 8th grade I've dreamed of building an AI that could draft players and choose lineups for me. I started off in Excel and have since worked my way up to more sophisticated machine learning. The one thing that I've been lacking is really good data, which is why I decided to scrape `pro-football-reference.com` for all recorded NFL player data. 

From what I've been able to determine researching, this is the most complete public source of NFL player stats available online. I scraped every NFL player in their database going back to the 1940s. That's over 25,000 players who have played over 1,000,000 football games. 

# Shameless plug
When I wrote this scraper back in 2017, I had two people reach out to me who shared my passion for fantasy football and data science. We quickly decided to band together to create machine-learning-generated fantasy football predictions. Our website is https://gridironai.com. Over the last several years, we've worked to add dozens of data sources to our data stream that's collected weekly. Feel free to use this scraper for basic stats, but if you'd like a more complete dataset that's updated every week, check out our site.
